	<h1>iPhone in 2017 will feature curved glass, 5.8-inch AMOLED display and much more</h1>

	<p>
		With calls for Apple's upcoming iPhone models to be "spectacular", it appears that pundits and those who have been quick 
		to proclaim that we've reached 'peak iPhone' have nothing to worry about. While we'll know what type of wild new features 
		the iPhone 7 will incorporate in just about three months, a new report from reputed analyst Ming-Chi Kuo provides us with 
		some interesting insight as to what Apple has planned for 2017 when it releases what will presumably be called the iPhone 7s.
