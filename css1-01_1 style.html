	<h1>iPhone in 2017 will feature curved glass, 5.8-inch AMOLED display and much more</h1>

	<p>
		With calls for Apple's upcoming iPhone models to be "spectacular", it appears that pundits and those who have been quick 
		to proclaim that we've reached 'peak iPhone' have nothing to worry about. While we'll know what type of wild new features 
		the iPhone 7 will incorporate in just about three months, a new report from reputed analyst Ming-Chi Kuo provides us with 
		some interesting insight as to what Apple has planned for 2017 when it releases what will presumably be called the iPhone 7s.

		According to a research note Kuo provided to investors, and subsequently obtained by AppleInsider, Apple is busy working 
		on an iPhone model with curved pieces of glass and an AMOLED display. What's more, the report relays that Apple also has 
		plans to shake up its iPhone lineup with a model sporting a 5.8-inch display. Notably, this isn't the first time we've 
		seen reports pointing to Apple shifting away from the LCD display technology that has served the iPhone so well over the 
		past 8 and a half years. Earlier in the month, a report from Nikkei claimed that Apple was in talks with supply partners 
		about ramping up OLED display production ahead of what was initially a 2018 timetable.

	<p>
		As for the iPhone 7s, Kuo, who has a rather impressive track record with respect to Apple rumors, said that the design 
		will incorporate glass on the front and back of the device, similar in style to the design of the iPhone 4 and 4s. Only 
		difference is, the iPhone 7s will incorporate curved glass panels on both the front and back and metal on the sides. 
		What's more, Kuo believes that the bezels on the iPhone 7s will be smaller than they are on Apple's current iPhone lineup.
