	<h1>
	A Platform for Web Development
	</h1>
	
	<p>
	A lot of the new features of HTML center around creating a better
	platform for web-based applications. From more descriptive tags and
	better cross-site and cross-window communication to animations and
	improved multimedia support, developers using HTML5 have a lot of
	new tools to build better user experiences.
	</p>

	<h2>
	More Descriptive Markup
	</h2>
	
	<p>
	Each version of HTML introduces some new markup, but never before
	have there been so many new additions that directly relate to describing
	content. You’ll learn about elements for defining headings, footers,
	navigation sections, sidebars, and articles in Chapter 2, New Structural
	Tags and Attributes, on page 24. You’ll also learn about meters,
	progress bars, and how custom data attributes can help you mark up
	data.

	<h2>
	Multimedia with Less Reliance on Plug-ins
	</h2>
	
	<p>
	You don’t need Flash or Silverlight for video, audio, and vector graphics
	anymore. Although Flash-based video players are relatively simple
	to use, they don’t work on Apple’s mobile devices. That’s a significant
	market, so you’ll need to learn how to use non-Flash video alternatives.
	In Chapter 7, Embedding Audio and Video, on page 127, you’ll see how
	to use HTML5 audio and video with effective fallbacks.
