	<h1>The Wolf and the Seven Little Kids 大野狼與七隻羊</h1>
	
	<hr>

	<p>
		It was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called: 'Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought something back with her for each of you.' But the little kids knew that it was the wolf, by the rough voice. 'We will not open the door,' cried they, 'you are not our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice, but your voice is rough; you are the wolf!' Then the wolf went away to a shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made his voice soft with it. Then he came back, knocked at the door of the house, and called: 'Open the door, dear children, your mother is here and has brought something back with her for each of you.' But the wolf had laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them and cried: 'We will not open the door, our mother has not black feet like you: you are the wolf!' Then the wolf ran to a baker and said: 'I have hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me.' And when the baker had rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said: 'Strew some white meal over my feet for me.' The miller thought to himself: 'The wolf wants to deceive someone,' and refused; but the wolf said: 'If you will not do it, I will devour you.' Then the miller was afraid, and made his paws white for him. Truly, this is the way of mankind.

		So now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at it and said: 'Open the door for me, children, your dear little mother has come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the forest with her.' The little kids cried: 'First show us your paws that we may know if you are our dear little mother.' Then he put his paws in through the window and when the kids saw that they were white, they believed that all he said was true, and opened the door. But who should come in but the wolf! They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves. One sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the stove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the sixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case. But the wolf found them all, and used no great ceremony; one after the other he swallowed them down his throat. The youngest, who was in the clock-case, was the only one he did not find. When the wolf had satisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid himself down under a tree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep.

		沒過多久，有人敲門，而且大聲說：「開門哪，我的好孩子。你們的媽媽回來了，還給 你們每個人帶來了一點東西。」可是，小山羊們聽到粗啞的聲音，立刻知道是狼來了。「我 們不開門，」牠們大聲說：「你不是我們的媽媽。我們的媽媽說話時聲音又軟又好聽，而你 的聲音非常粗啞，你是狼！」於是，狼跑到雜貨商那裡，買了一大塊白堊土，吃了下去，結 果嗓子變細了。然後牠又回來敲山羊家的門，喊道：「開門哪，我的好孩子。你們的媽媽回 來了，給你們每個人都帶了點東西。」可是狼把牠的黑爪子搭在了窗戶上，小山羊們看到黑 爪子便一起叫道：「我們不開門。我們的媽媽沒有你這樣的黑爪子。你是狼！」於是狼跑到 麵包師那裡，對他說：「我的腳受了點傷，給我用麵糰揉一揉。」等麵包師用麵糰給它揉過 之後，狼又跑到磨坊主那裡，對他說：「在我的腳上灑點白麵粉。」磨坊主想：狼肯定是 想去騙什麼人，便拒絕了牠的要求。可是狼說：「要是你不給我灑麵粉，我就把你吃 掉。」磨坊主害怕了，只好灑了點麵粉，把狼的爪子弄成了白色。人就是這個德行！

		這個壞蛋第三次跑到山羊家，一面敲門一面說：「開門哪，孩子們。你們的好媽媽回來 了，還從森林裡給你們每個人帶回來一些東西。」小山羊們叫道：「你先把腳給我們看看， 好讓我們知道你是不是我們的媽媽。」狼把爪子伸進窗戶，小山羊們看到爪子是白的，便相 信牠說的是真話，打開了屋門。然而進來的是狼！小山羊們嚇壞了，一個個都想躲起來。第 一隻小山羊跳到了桌子下，第二隻鑽進了被子，第三隻躲到了爐子裡，第四隻跑進了廚房， 第五隻藏在櫃子裡，第六隻擠在洗臉盆下，第七隻爬進了鐘盒裡。狼把牠們一個個都找了出 來，毫不客氣地把牠們全都吞進了肚子。只有躲在鐘盒裡的那隻最小的山羊沒有被狼發現。 狼吃飽了之後，心滿意足地離開了山羊家，來到綠草地上的一棵大樹下，躺下身子開始呼呼 大睡起來。
